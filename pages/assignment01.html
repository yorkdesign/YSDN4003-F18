			<h4>10% Of The Semester</h4>
			<h1>Assignment 1 - Design Strategy</h1>
			<p><a href="../documents/YSDN4003_Assignment_1.pdf" target="_blank">Evaluation Criteria</a></p>
			<h2>In the context of this class, students are invited to explore a topic of their choosing and their personal modes of visual expression through the creation of a screen-based interface. The interface can be developed for any device/medium, as long as it is relevant to the context of the student’s project. The medium can be traditional or speculative.</h2><h2> As such, interfaces could be created for items as diversified as mobile, tablet, desktop, watch, wall installation, glasses, fridge, windows, museum screens, clothing, etc., provided that the chosen medium is imagined as being interactive for the purpose of the project. Every students should think outside the box.</h2>

			<p>Students are encouraged to think beyond the notion of “problem solving” and to either overlap or blur the boundaries between multiple approaches to interactive design such as exploratory, utilitarian and speculative approaches. The application developed will be an expression of the student’s personal exploration of interactive design and of the chosen topic, but it <span class="bold">must</span> have a precise goal/use, be engaging, provide users with a satisfying <span class="bold">user experience</span>, wonder, surprise and ultimately promote recurring usage.</p>

			<h5>Stage 1 - Research</h5>


			<p>First, students need to narrow down topics they are interested in. </p>
			<section class="blockquote">
				<p>Attention: It is important to note that the chosen topic will follow you throughout the semester. Students need to make sure that they are comfortable with and highly interested in this topic from the start. </p>
			</section>
			<p>Remember, looking at other interfaces is not the only way to find inspiration when working on an digital project or when developing an interface. Go beyond the screen. As mentioned by Golden Krishna, <a href="http://www.nointerface.com/book/" target="_blank">The Best Interface is No Interface</a>. Do an inspiration and research session outside of the digital spectrum—go to the library, open a magazine, visit some art exhibition, etc.</p>

			<br>

			<p>The outcome of your initial research should be a one pager (either HTML or pdf format) including your possible topics and a one sentence summary of what the goal of the project would be for each selected topic. </p>

			<br>

			<p>Each of the area of interests listed should be complemented by a project analysis and references of either digital or physical artefacts that inspire you in relation to this topic.</p>

			<br><br>
			<p class="bold">This analysis should include:</p>

			<ul>
  				<li class="italic">If this was your topic, what would the goal of the project be?</li>
  				<li class="italic">What do you like about this idea?</li>
  				<li class="italic">What could potentially be your inspirations for this project?</li>
  				<li class="italic">How do you imagine the general visual design of the project?</li>
			</ul>

			<br><br>
				
			
		 

		 <p>Make sure that your research is well prepared, that your idea is clearly defined and that your descriptive sentence communicates your intent clearly.</p><br><p>On week 2, each student will take the podium for 5min to explain their research during a collaborative class workshop and efficient communication is key for this exercise to be productive/useful.</p><br>

		 <section class="blockquote">
		 	<p>Remember, if an existing application does something similar to what you were hoping to create it doesn't mean that you can’t do so.</p>
		 </section>

		<p>It is definitely possible to leverage an idea that is already being exploited and to appropriate it for your own project… as long as you truly treat it differently/in an original way.</p>
